# SynergyFit Deployment Issues - Technical Summary

## Current Status
Both services are deployed to Render but experiencing issues:
- **Frontend**: Returns "Not Found" error
- **Backend API**: Returns 404 JSON response `{"success":false,"message":"Route not found","timestamp":"2025-08-03T05:02:18.545Z"}`

## Architecture Overview
- **Frontend**: React SPA built with Vite
- **Backend**: Express.js REST API with MongoDB Atlas
- **Deployment Platform**: Render (using render.yaml configuration)

## Deployment Configuration

### Backend Service (synergyfit-api)
- **Type**: Web Service
- **Build Command**: `cd backend && npm ci`
- **Start Command**: `cd backend && npm start`
- **Health Check**: `/api/v1/health`
- **Expected Base URL**: `https://synergyfit-api.onrender.com`
- **API Routes**: All prefixed with `/api/v1/*`

### Frontend Service (synergyfit-app)
- **Type**: Static Site
- **Build Command**: `cd frontend && npm install && npm run build`
- **Static Publish Path**: `frontend/dist`
- **Routes**: SPA rewrite rule `/* -> /index.html`
- **Expected URL**: `https://synergyfit-app.onrender.com`

## Build Output Analysis

From the frontend build logs:
```
dist/index.html                     0.71 kB â”‚ gzip:   0.37 kB
dist/assets/index-DaNDwIK7.css     84.80 kB â”‚ gzip:  13.70 kB
dist/assets/ui-CijTYM0z.js         26.23 kB â”‚ gzip:   5.91 kB
dist/assets/router-Cj5MPlnt.js     33.77 kB â”‚ gzip:  12.54 kB
dist/assets/vendor-BDC5HmX-.js    142.09 kB â”‚ gzip:  45.55 kB
dist/assets/index-aLGU7W0w.js   1,020.72 kB â”‚ gzip: 281.84 kB
```

The build is successful and generating files in the expected location.

## Identified Issues

### 1. Frontend "Not Found" Error
**Symptoms**: 
- Build succeeds
- Files are generated in `dist/` directory
- Render reports "Your site is live ðŸŽ‰"
- But accessing the URL returns "Not Found"

**Possible Causes**:
1. **Static Publish Path Issue**: The path `frontend/dist` might not be correctly resolved by Render
2. **Working Directory Mismatch**: Build command changes to `frontend` directory, but Render might expect paths relative to root
3. **Missing index.html**: Although build shows it exists, Render might not find it in the expected location

**What We've Tried**:
- Changed from `./frontend/dist` to `frontend/dist`
- Confirmed build outputs to correct location
- Verified SPA rewrite rules are in place

### 2. Backend API 404 Error
**Symptoms**:
- Returns proper JSON error format (indicating Express is running)
- 404 suggests routing issue, not deployment failure

**Possible Causes**:
1. **Base Path Issue**: Accessing root `/` instead of `/api/v1/*` endpoints
2. **Missing Route Handler**: The root path `/` isn't defined in the Express app
3. **Environment Variables**: Missing required env vars could cause route registration to fail

**Expected Behavior**:
- Root `/` should return 404 (as designed)
- `/api/v1/health` should return health check response
- `/api/v1/auth/login` and other endpoints should be accessible

## Environment Variables Status

### Required for Backend:
- `MONGODB_URI`: MongoDB Atlas connection string (sensitive - removed from git)
- `JWT_SECRET`: JWT signing secret (sensitive - removed from git)
- `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`: Should include frontend URL

### Required for Frontend:
- `VITE_API_URL`: Should point to backend API URL

**Note**: Production .env files were accidentally committed to git but have been removed in commit 7c7bf66.

## File Structure
```
ripped-potato/
â”œâ”€â”€ backend/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ server.js (Express app entry point)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ .env.production.template
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ dist/ (build output)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ vite.config.js
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ render.yaml (deployment configuration)
â””â”€â”€ package.json (root workspace)
```

## Debugging Recommendations

### For Frontend Issue:
1. **Verify Build Output Location**: 
   - SSH into Render instance or check build artifacts
   - Confirm `frontend/dist/index.html` exists after build

2. **Test Alternative Publish Paths**:
   - Try `dist` (if Render's working directory is already `frontend`)
   - Try absolute path from repo root

3. **Check Render's Static Site Behavior**:
   - Verify how Render handles the working directory for static sites
   - Check if additional configuration is needed for monorepo structure

### For Backend Issue:
1. **Test Health Endpoint**: 
   - `curl https://synergyfit-api.onrender.com/api/v1/health`
   - This should return a success response if backend is running

2. **Verify Environment Variables**:
   - Ensure all required env vars are set in Render dashboard
   - Check if missing env vars are preventing route registration

3. **Check Logs**:
   - Look for startup errors or route registration issues
   - Verify MongoDB connection is successful

## Alternative Deployment Approaches

If current issues persist, consider:

1. **Separate Repositories**: Deploy frontend and backend from separate repos
2. **Different Build Structure**: Build frontend to root-level dist folder
3. **Docker Deployment**: Use Dockerfiles for more control over build process
4. **Alternative Platforms**: Consider Vercel for frontend, Railway/Fly.io for backend

## Security Note
Production credentials were temporarily exposed in git history. Although removed, consider:
- Rotating all secrets (MongoDB password, JWT secret)
- Auditing MongoDB Atlas access logs
- Implementing secret scanning in CI/CD pipeline

## Next Steps
1. Verify exact file paths after Render build
2. Test API endpoints individually
3. Review Render's documentation for monorepo deployments
4. Consider opening support ticket with Render for platform-specific guidance
